        A worker method is an operation that should be performed periodically and
        indefinitely in a separate thread. This method should return True on a
        successful run, and False on an unsuccessful run.

        This function takes a method that performs one iteration of the work and
        instruments it with the loop and thread. The worker loop checks as a stopping
        condition for the Event "workers_halt" to be set. This is a way to coordinate
        app shutdown by stopping all workers.

        Optionally, it also installs a "heartbeat monitor" for the worker, such that
        an error will be logged if the worker has not run successfully for some amount
        of time, whether by returning False consistently or simply not executing.

        Args:
            worker_method: the method, which should execute one iteration of the
                desired job.
            delay: the amount of time to wait between each execution of the worker.
                As implemented this is a simple sleep, so the actual delay between
                invocations will be delay + execution time.
            suppress: a list of exception types which will be caught and suppressed
                with a warning in the worker thread. Other exceptions are considered
                fatal and will result in app shutdown.
            heartbeat: an optional float. If not None, this will request that a monitor
                thread regularly check that the worker has not failed to execute for
                at least this many seconds. If this check fails, the app is terminated
                with an appropriate message.
        Returns:
            a Thread object which when started will execute the worker in a loop.
